# OrderDataService
OrderDataService is a .NET console app using SQLite to store customers, orders and items. It loads data into dictionaries for lookups, supports add/view/delete flows, and showcases basic CRUD, caching, and integrity checks. It has been great for learning simple data services, collections and SQL basics. Includes menu driven prompts for quick demos.
